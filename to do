To do

Inför labb:

- Check if we want more than one obstacle (insect) to appear or randomize pictures? Math.Random for it possibly.
- Rename obstacle to insects?
- The snail at first shows on the right of the screen and gets all morphed before appearing as it should. this happened to me before and eveline helped me but it had to do with the background-repeat: no-repeat; but this time it doesn't work... it might have to do with the z-index...
- I feel that the fairy doesn't collide with the snail when it should but i am unsure where to fix that.
- Stop the parallax from starting over in different spots and just flow
- Make the floating keyframe work for the fairies in the start, win or lose screens cause right now if we comment them in again there is no collision happening between the fairy and the snail. It might have to do with where the code is positioned in the html or if the z-index makes a difference to all of the game functions in the css...
