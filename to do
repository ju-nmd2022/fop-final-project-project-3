Fix if there's time

- How do we stop the parallax from "starting over? in different spots and just flow?
- Check if we want five lives to count down before you lose
- Check if we want the character to be able to collect objects while playing
- Fix so that the hearts disappear (lives = 5) when you hit an obstacle and after five times you lose

To do

- DONE! --- Make start screen like endscreen to make it easier to explain in the interview. See "end" in html and javascript!
- DONE! --- Change colors on buttons (and hover buttons), text and background of endscreen + add other things in the endscreen like a passing cloud or something?
- DONE! --- Change speed on parallax (cloud, mountain etc) in css to make it flow better and that you can see they move in different speeds
- Connect startscreen with main game like endscreen and change startbutton from reload() to take it back to the startscreen instead
- Fix trailer.

- Added the image for the jumping rabbit and it appears when you press the up key but now the rabbit won't jump (visibly)... needs fixing.
- Put all interval timers into one function. Not sure how but chatgpt told me how to do it and i did it that way
- Tried adding code to decrease the five lives everytime you lose and then you get the result but all five hearts disappear as one when you hit an obstacle... Needs attention
