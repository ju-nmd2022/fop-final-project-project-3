To do

Inför labb:

- Rename obstacle to insects?

Ask at lab:

- The snail at first shows on the right of the screen and gets all morphed before appearing as it should. this happened to me before and eveline helped me but it had to do with the background-repeat: no-repeat; but this time it doesn't work... it might have to do with the z-index...
- I feel that the fairy doesn't collide with the snail when it should but i am unsure where to fix that.
- Stop the parallax from starting over in different spots and just flow?
